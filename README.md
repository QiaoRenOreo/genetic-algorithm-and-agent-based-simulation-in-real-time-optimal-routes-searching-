apply genetic algorithm and agent-based simulation in real-time optimal routes searching in order to avoid traffic congestion

## Part1. Problem definition: 
Traffic congestion is a big problem in a lot of cities in China, especially Shanghai. The traditional way to solve this problem is: GPS takes traffic congestion into account and provides the most time-saving route to drivers. GPS only predicts a SINGLE best route. This causes a new problem:  a lot of drivers move onto this best route. The best route become congested. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a solution that distributes the vehicles and prevent the occurrence of new congestion.

## Part2. Research question: 
whether or not providing drivers with multiple routes will prevent the occurrence of new congestion?

## Part3. Agent-based modelling and UML

## Part4. Genetic algorithm
